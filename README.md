# Created Repositories
# First,  i created  three repositories on GitHub:

# frontend-repo, backend-repo and fullstack-repo: This will manage frontend-repo and backend-repo, and will have a configuration file.

# Set Up frontend-repo and backend-repo
# In frontend-repo, make a file named client.py. This file will use environment variables to connect to the server.

# In backend-repo, make another file named server.py. This file will use environment variables to run the server.


# Seted Up fullstack-repo
# In the fullstack-repo, i made a configuration file named config.env. This file will have variables like the server address and port. These variables will be used by both client.py and server.py.


# Seted Up GitHub Actions Workflow
# CreateD a GitHub Actions workflow in fullstack-repo. This workflow will automatically copy changes from frontend-repo and backend-repo whenever there is a push to the main branch.
